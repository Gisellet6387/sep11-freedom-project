* [Blog Entry 1](entries/entry01.md)

The freedom project we are doing is a way to be able to focus on one topic we are interested in and to make a website about it. Not only will we learn to make a website but we will also be able to inform ourselves and others about our topics. 

So far the project I’ve decided to work on is the evolution of planetariums. When I was little I was taken on a trip to a planetarium and I was fascinated by them. It interested me how technology has evolved to the point they made space seem so close even though it’s so far away. I would sit there and get transported to space even though in real life it didn’t seem that simple, but with the help of planetariums it made it seem that way. 

As a kid you only notice on the little things like the fact we can see space but now looking back I got many more questions. I want to learn how planetariums have changed over time and inform other people who have the same questions. 

I will focus on finding helpful information and incorporating it into my website to the point people will be able to find information easily. I want to not only help others and inform them but it will also help me learn about this topic that really caught my attention. 

This will help the community who is interested in learning about this topic as well as me. Which is why I’ll try my best to inform the people correctly.
